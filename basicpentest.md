# Basic Pentesting

This lesson is to introduce you to a practical cyber security exercise on the concept of a basic penetration test. Given that we know the IP address of a machine, we can gather intelligence about the machine that will then enable us to gain access to the machine, and escalate from a standard user to an administrator to have full control of the machine.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand what a penetration test is, and experience a practical example.
- Learn practical techniques of information gathering, for service and Linux enumeration.
- Learn techniques for password brute forcing, and password hash cracking.
- Reflect on computer security weaknesses and how best to mitigate against these.

## Task

We will work through a basic pentesting exercise, that can be deployed either on TryHackMe or using a local Virtual Machine (e.g., VirtualBox). The aim is to show you the process that a penetration tester may work through, and how a supposedly secure system can be compromised to allow administrative access to an attacker. During our practical session, we will work through the challenge of information gathering, gaining initial access by discovering a vulnerable user account and escalating privilege so that we can have administrative access. Whilst a synthetic example, it is important to reflect on how this kind of attack may work against your own systems. Watch the [online video guide](https://youtu.be/Eus1f82BU4o).

1. To begin, please go to http://www.tryhackme.com and sign up for an account.
2. Go to the room: [https://tryhackme.com/room/basicpentesting](https://tryhackme.com/room/basicpentestingjt)
3. Click "Start AttackBox" to launch the web-based virtual machine that we will use.
4. Click "Start Machine" to launch the vulnerable machine that we will attempt to 
access.
5. Let’s see what we can find out about our target...

## Further information

1. Use NMAP to scan to find all services exposed by the target machine
2. What is the name of the hidden directory that is accessible on the web server?
3. What is the username you have discovered?
4. With the information you have found, use Burp Suite to brute-force the password of this user
6. What is their password?
7. What service is available that you can use to access the server?
8. Enumerate the machine to find any possible vectors for performing privilege escalation.
9. What is the username of the other user you have found?
10. With this new username, can you find anything on the system that may enable access to their account?
11. What is their password?
12. From their account, can you get access to the root user account?
