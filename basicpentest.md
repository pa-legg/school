# Basic Pentesting

The purpose of this task is to introduce you to a practical cyber security exercise. Often, 
organisations may ask for a “vulnerability assessment”, or a “penetration test” of their 
systems. A vulnerability assessment is a systematic approach to examining core assets and 
measuring whether they pose a threat to the organisation against a set of criteria. A 
penetration test is where an “attacker” will attempt to gain access to a system, and they will 
document their process for achieving this.

We will work through a basic pentesting exercise on TryHackMe. The aim is to show you the 
process that a penetration tester may work through, and how a supposedly secure system 
can be compromised to allow administrative access to an attacker. During our practical 
session, we will work through the challenge of information gathering, gaining initial access 
by discovering a vulnerable user account and escalating privilege so that we can have 
administrative access. Whilst a synthetic example, it is important to reflect on how this kind 
of attack may work against your own systems. Watch the [online video guide](https://youtu.be/Eus1f82BU4o).

## Task
1. To begin, please go to http://www.tryhackme.com and sign up for an account.
2. Go to the room: [https://tryhackme.com/room/basicpentesting](https://tryhackme.com/room/basicpentestingjt)
3. Click "Start AttackBox" to launch the web-based virtual machine that we will use.
4. Click "Start Machine" to launch the vulnerable machine that we will attempt to 
access.
5. Let’s see what we can find out about our target...

* Find the services exposed by the machine
* What is the name of the hidden directory on the web server(enter name without /)?
* User brute-forcing to find the username & password
* What is the username?
* What is the password?
* What service do you use to access the server(answer in abbreviation in all caps)?
* Enumerate the machine to find any vectors for privilege escalation
* What is the name of the other user you found(all lower case)?
* If you have found another user, what can you do with this information?
* What is the final password you obtain?
