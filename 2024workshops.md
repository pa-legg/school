# CyberWEST are calling all Teachers! Join us for a FREE Cyber Security Education workshop and be part of the South West regional network.

**University of the West of England (UWE), along with University of Bristol, University of Exeter, University of Plymouth, and the Odyssey Learning Alliance (NCCE Hub)**, have partnered together to offer a series of regional workshops to support schools and teachers in Cyber Security Education. The initiative is supported by the National Cyber Security Centre, through the Academic Centre of Excellence in Cyber Security Education (ACE-CSE) scheme.

**We will be hosting workshops across all 4 Universities, and we invite teachers to join us at one of our regional events to learn more about running practical hands-on activities for teaching cyber security in your lessons.**

Workshops will be hosted on the following dates:
- Wednesday 17th January 2024 – University of the West of England
- Tuesday 23rd January 2024 – University of Exeter
- Tuesday 30th January 2024 – University of Bristol
- Tuesday 6th February 2024 – University of Plymouth

**Thanks to the NCSC we can offer £150 per school to support supply teacher cover for attending a workshop.**

At each workshop, you will find:
- Practical teaching examples that you can use in your classrooms with lesson materials and plans mapping to the curriculum.
- Activity walk-throughs by staff to showcase how to run the activities as part of lessons or code clubs.
- Support from the wider University and schools’ networks to help you.
- Access to our equipment loan library for running practical activities.

We aim to support schools in the creation and delivery of practical activities for teaching cyber security education, and we are working to reduce the burden on teachers for making this a reality. All attending schools can request access to our South West regional equipment loan library, to help them make use of teaching materials and deliver innovative practical teaching as mapped against the current key stage curriculum.
